Transcriptomics: Introduction

Transcriptomics is the comprehensive analysis of all transcripts, including both coding and noncoding RNA molecules, present in a given cell type, tissue, or organ. The transcriptome represents the entire mRNA content of a cell and is the initial product of genome expression. Transcriptome analysis is crucial for understanding the functional elements of the genome practically in areas focused on biomarker discovery across various cancers,
Tumor biomarkers are the substances that are produced by tumors or the body’s responses to tumors during tumorigenesis and progression so the development of novel technologies, such as revolutionary next-generation sequencing, enables the identification of cancer biomarkers, gene signatures, and their aberrant expression affecting oncogenesis, as well as the discovery of molecular targets for anticancer therapies. And that is what transcriptomics do in cancer research

2- Importance of identifying biomarkers in Cancer Research

Due to cancer complexity and heterogeneity Biomarkers are vital in healthcare as They provide valuable insights into disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment response, and personalized medicine. They serve as objective indicators, enabling early detection and intervention
The role of transcriptomics: Transcriptomics focuses on gene expression at the RNA level and offers genome-wide information on gene structure and gene function to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in specific biological processes.

3- Case study

Transcriptomic analysis was conducted to identify genes involved in hippocampal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This analysis revealed a significant abundance of downregulated genes across the disease spectrum of hippocampal vulnerability in AD. Notably, SIRT1 was found to be upregulated, while PSEN2 was downregulated, highlighting their potential roles in disease progression.
Total RNA was extracted from dissected hippocampal tissue from several samples, followed by RNA-Seq analysis. Differential gene expression and enrichment analysis were performed using the edgeR package (v3.12.0) to identify differentially expressed genes. The analysis compared typical AD cases to controls (representative phenotype) and limbic predominant AD cases to hippocampal sparing AD cases (extreme phenotype). Enrichment analysis further identified key pathways and gene ontology categories enriched in these differentially expressed genes. That is an example of the importance of transcriptomic analysis

4- conclusion

Transcriptomics aims to identify a wide range of transcriptional processes, including functional annotation of the genome, transcriptional structure, start sites, splicing, posttranslational modifications, and differentially expressed genes and understanding the complexity of cancer and disease mechanisms, and the biomarker discovery have the main role for understanding various cancer also the developments in transcriptomic technologies like spatial transcriptomics will give more vital insights into cancer research.
